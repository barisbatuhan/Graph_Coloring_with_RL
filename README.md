# Graph Coloring with Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning algorithm that deals with an accurate solution for graph coloring problems.

## Steps to Follow in each Gandalf Login and COde Compilation:

- **Apply Once:** module load gcc/8.2.0

- **During compilation:** add -fopenmp and -O3 flags

## Directories

- *Optimal_Coloring* has optimal color giving algorithm with its results.

- *Greedy_Coloring* includes whole Graph API with coloring functions included. Also it provides *.ipynb* file for correlation etc. checking for the CSV files created.

- *Matrices* has 2 foldes: small and large. THe graphs are stored in these folders with respect to their sizes. 

- *Csv* includes all the ordering and coloring results we have found so far.
